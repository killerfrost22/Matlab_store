%%
% 4. Suppose you wish to find values of x where f (x) = 0, but f is given first in terms
% of y, and then a second equation determines y for any given x.
% Let f(y) = y^3 + 3*y + 1, and y + x = e^(-6*y) .
% To evaluate f given x, the second equation must first be solved for y and then this
% value substituted into f(y).

%%
% (a) Describe how the bisection method could be used to find an x such that f(x) = 0.
%%
%    According to the Intermediate Theorem we can to find an interval where zhe zero of f(y) lies in.
%    Then try different number a and b to get f(a)>0 and f(b)<0, then we have an interval we want.
%    Use bisection method to find the zero of f(y) in the interval.
%    As the interval become smaller and smaller, we got the midpoint close enought to the zero of f(y).
%    Then we can plug the zero of f(y) which is the y value it into y + x = e^(-6*y) to get
%    the x value we need.

%%
% (b) Writing f as f(y(x)), explain how Newtonâ€™s method could be used to find the root
% x such that f(x) = 0.
%%
%    First we take a gusee where is the zero of f(y(x)) could be and denote it as y0,
%    then we apporximate the root by let y_(n+1) = y_n - [f(y_n)/f'(y_n)] until a sufficiently
%    precise value is reach. then plug that y_(n+1) into y + x = e^(-6*y) to get the x value we need.

%%
% (c) Using MATLAB (and any method you prefer), find the root x where f (x) = 0.
